## **Curiosity's Conundrum**

Curiosity's Conundrum is a game where you control a Mars Rover equipped with a cannon. Your goal is to survive and achieve as high of a score as possible.

Enemies spawn in waves, and the probability of an enemy spawning increases as the game progresses. 

The player needs to dodge alien projectiles and shoot down UFO’s. 

If a bomb hits the ground, there will be a growing blast radius which your rover will need to avoid. 

There is a chance that upgrades will drop after destroying UFO’s, which give increased movement speed, fire rate or bullet speed. 

Your rover has three lives and will lose lives if it collides with an enemy projectile. 

Every five waves, a boss fight will occur. The rover is located on the bottom of the screen. The player can control the rover using A and D or using the arrow keys. The player can aim using the mouse and shoot by holding the left mouse button.

* Controls:
* A / Left Arrow Key = Move left
* D / Right Arrow Key = Move right
* Left Mouse Button = Shoot
